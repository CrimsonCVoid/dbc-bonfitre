            Beach Safety Rules

          <p className="mt-5">
            To help keep the beach safe and follow county regulations, glass
            is strictly prohibited at all bonfires. Any glass brought to the
            event may result in a $250 fee per item and could require the
            bonfire to be canceled or shut down. Balloons are also not
            allowed because of their impact on the environment and local
            wildlife.
